# üöÄ CPU-scheduler
An RTOS simulation of FCFS, and MLFQ scheduling.

The results of this experiment prove that MLFQ is better than FCFS in terms of CPU utilization, waiting time, turnaround time, and response time. MLFQ has significantly better performance than FCFS. üéâ

## üíª Steps to run the code in the terminal
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o PROJ PROJ.cpp && ./PROJ
```

## üêû Debug in Visual Studio Code with gdb
To debug C++ code in Visual Studio Code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Visual Studio Code installed
- C++ extension for Visual Studio Code
- `g++` and `gdb` installed on your system

### Setup Instructions

1. **Configure `tasks.json`:**
   - Define a task to compile your C++ code with `g++`. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "2.0.0",
       "tasks": [
         {
           "label": "build",
           "type": "shell",
           "command": "g++",
           "args": "-std=c++11", //Add the -std=c++11 here
           "group": {
             "kind": "build",
             "isDefault": true
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Configure `launch.json`:**
   - Set the `miDebuggerPath` to your installation path of `gdb`. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "name": "(gdb) Launch",
           "type": "cppdbg",
           "request": "launch",
           "program": "${workspaceFolder}/your_program",
           "args": [],
           "stopAtEntry": false,
           "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
           "environment": [],
           "externalConsole": false,
           "MIMode": "gdb",
           "miDebuggerPath": "/usr/local/bin/gdb", // Update this path to gdb here
           "setupCommands": [
             {
               "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
               "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
               "ignoreFailures": true
             }
           ],
           "preLaunchTask": "build"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
